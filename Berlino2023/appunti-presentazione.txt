STIMULI AS FIXED EFFECTS

Tendency to consdier stimuli as fixed effects and participants as random 
The generalizbuility is at the respondent level 
The stimuli/item are taken to exahust the entire population they represent 

This conceptualization might be appropriate when consdieringquestoonnaire and tests but might 
need a reframing when considering experiments where stimuli representing different categories are employed 

In these instances, the stimuli used in the experiment are clearly just a random sample representing the larger 
population, that is the categories to which the stimulus belong 

So why not considering the sampling variability also at the stimulus level? 
Not considering the sampling variability at the stimulus level might have two main consequences: 

- biased estimates 
- the implication on the generalizability of the results 
- Loss of information because a large part of information in the data is simply overlooked 


## Biased estimates 

Tutta la parte della tesi dove dico che ignorare la variabuilitÃ  dello stimolo per calcolare dei opunteggi 
della persona rende le stinme ottenute piene di errore 
(il paper di barr) 

## Implication for the generalizability of the results 

Results can be generalized at the respodents level not at the stimulus level --> only if the experiment
is replicated with the exact same set of stimuli 

very limting also in the sense of integrating ther euslts of the study with theoretical considerations 

## Loss of information 

There is so much information in the data that we are simply ignoring 

## How to solve this issue? 

Considering both respondents and stimuli as random factors from larger populations 

And pratcically? LMMS 

Also categorical responses become exteremly informative... and connected with a classical model in psychometrics when statistics
meets psychoemtrics 

## Rasch model, GLMMS and random effects 

Rasch model 
Link function 
Random effects 

Why is it useful in psycghology? 

Experiments where the same stimulus is presented over and over again to the same respondents in at least 
two conditions 

the stimuli are indeed random realizations of a larger population 
The rasch model could not be applied per se given the local dependence between the trials due to the random noise in the data 

## An application

The implicit association test commonly used for evaluating the preference for one category over an opposite one 
Stimuli representing 4 different categories that have to be sorted correclty in the least amount of time by the respondents 
in two contrasting conditions 

The usual score is the stadarduized difference between the respone times in the two conditions --> categorical response correct/wrong 
are almost completely overlooked 

cannot understand whether it is the peference towrads one of the category or the dislike towards its opposite category
